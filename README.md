# color-picker-chrome-extension
This JavaScript app lets users select colors from their screen using the EyeDropper API. It displays picked colors in a list, enables copying color values to the clipboard, exports the colors as a text file, and provides a clear all function. Picked colors are stored in local storage to persist between sessions.
