# ‚≠ê Color Picker Chrome Extension ‚≠ê

This JavaScript application enables users to select colors from their screen using the EyeDropper API. It displays the picked colors in a list, allows copying color values to the clipboard, exports the colors as a text file, and provides functionality to clear all saved colors. The picked colors are stored in local storage to persist between sessions.
